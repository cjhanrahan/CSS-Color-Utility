CSS-Color-Utility
=================

This simple web app will be an advanced CSS color picker, with features absent from most popular online color pickers.

The features I want implement are:
- Instaneous conversion to and from RGB, hex, and HSL color systems
- The ability to test background / foreground color combinations as you drag the sliders
- One click copying to clipboard of properly formatted CSS values

I'm mainly doing this because I want to practice
- DOM manipulation without JQuery (as described at http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/)
- Working without popular frameworks
- Writing clean code
- Using Object.defineProperties
- Flex boxes (as described here http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
